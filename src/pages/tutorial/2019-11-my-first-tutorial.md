  Learn when to stop. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking
  around and having fun. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Let's have a
  little bit of fun today.


  We'll have a super time. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.
  If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.


  Isn't that fantastic? It all happens automatically. Isn't that fantastic? You
  can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can do anything
  here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. We'll put a happy
  little sky in here. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.

Have fun with it. We'll do another happy little painting. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. There we go. Let's get crazy.



This is a fantastic little painting. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. We'll make some happy little bushes here.



This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. We'll put a happy little bush here. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.
